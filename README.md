# Koren's triode model estimation

The following scripts were adapted from the original Matlab code
to run in Python using Numpy and Scipy. We also use Matplotlib
to generate the fit chart.

## Environment
Prepare the environment to run the code.

1. Get [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/) and install on your computer.
2. Make sure it's installed properly and available in terminal of your choice. To do so -- run `python --version`
3. Create a new environment with only the necessary packages.
